# Loan.Approval.Prediction
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved.

# The repository is organized as follows:
* <b>data/</b> contains the dataset used for the model.<br>
* <b>models/</b> contains the code for the machine learning models.<br>
* <b>notebooks/</b> contains the Jupyter notebook used to develop and evaluate the models.<br>
* <b>README.md</b> this file, which provides an overview of the repository.<br>
# To get started, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:
* git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Loan.Approval.Prediction.ipynb.git<br>
* cd Loan.Approval.Prediction.ipynb<br>
* pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Jupyter notebook to develop and evaluate the models.<br>
# The Jupyter notebook is divided into the following sections:
* <b>Data exploration</b> This section explores the dataset and summarizes the key features.<br>
* <b>Feature engineering</b> This section creates new features from the existing features.<br>
* <b>Model selection</b> This section evaluates different machine learning models and selects the best model.<br>
* <b>Model evaluation</b> This section evaluates the performance of the selected model on a held-out test set.<br>
<b>I hope this helps!</b>
